# E-commerce-App (MERN stack Project)

Overview
The E-Commerce Web App is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that provides a complete online shopping experience. Users can browse products, search for items, add them to their cart, and make payments securely via Stripe. The app supports Google login, real-time toast notifications, image uploads via Cloudinary, and includes a dedicated admin panel for managing products, orders, and users. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and API requests are managed via Axios.
